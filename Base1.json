Aleksa and Stack\nAfter the Serbian Informatics Olympiad, Aleksa was very sad, because he didn't win a medal (he didn't know stack), so Vasilije came to give him an easy problem, just to make his day better.\nVasilije gave Aleksa a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$n \\ge 3$$$) and asked him to construct a strictly increasing array of size $$$n$$$ of positive integers, such that\n$$$3\\cdot a_{i+2}$$$ is not divisible by $$$a_i+a_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i \\le n-2$$$).\nNote that a strictly increasing array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ is an array where $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$).\nSince Aleksa thinks he is a bad programmer now, he asked you to help him find such an array.\nInput\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

The $$$i$$$-th of these characters is '\n+\n', if the $$$i$$$-th notification tells that a subscriber goes online, and it is '\n-\n' otherwise.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line: \"\nYES\n\" if all $$$n$$$ subscribers are guaranteed to have read the post, \"\nNO\n\" if it is impossible for all $$$n$$$ subscribers to have read the post, and \"\nMAYBE\n\" otherwise.\nExample\nInput\n4\n5 5 3\n--+\n5 2 3\n++-\n5 4 2\n-+\n5 0 7\n++++-++\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nMAYBE\nYES\nNote\nIn the first test case, there are $$$5$$$ out of $$$5$$$ subscribers online in the very beginning, so they will all read the post no matter what. The answer is \"\nYES\n\".\nIn the second test case, the number of subscribers online becomes $$$4$$$ after the first two notifications, next someone goes offline, and thus the fifth subscriber has no chance of reading the post. It is impossible for all the subscribers to read the post, so the answer is \"\nNO\n\".\nIn the third test case, on the one hand, the same person may have gone offline and online (in this case only $$$4$$$ out of $$$5$$$ subscribers have read the post), on the other hand, the last notification may have told that the fifth subscriber has gone online (in this case all subscribers have read the post). We cannot deduce which of the two holds, so the answer is \"\nMAYBE\n\".\nIn the fourth test case, there have to be five subscribers online after all the notifications. All of them will read the post, so the answer is \"\nYES\n\"."

Sequence Game\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- \n- while loop\n- break statement\n- recursion\n- for loop\nTema and Vika are playing the following game.\nFirst, Vika comes up with a sequence of positive integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$m$$$ and writes it down on a piece of paper. Then she takes a new piece of paper and writes down the sequence $$$b$$$ according to the following rule:\nFirst, she writes down $$$a_1$$$.\nThen, she writes down only those $$$a_i$$$ ($$$2 \\le i \\le m$$$) such that $$$a_{i - 1} \\le a_i$$$. Let the length of this sequence be denoted as $$$n$$$.\nFor example, from the sequence $$$a=[4, 3, 2, 6, 3, 3]$$$, Vika will obtain the sequence $$$b=[4, 6, 3]$$$.\nShe then gives the piece of paper with the sequence $$$b$$$ to Tema. He, in turn, tries to guess the sequence $$$a$$$.\nTema considers winning in such a game highly unlikely, but still wants to find at least one sequence $$$a$$$ that could have been originally chosen by Vika. Help him and output any such sequence.\nNote that the length of the sequence you output should not exceed the input sequence length by more than two times.\nInput\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. This is followed by a description of the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence $$$b$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, b_3, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the sequence.\nThe sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output\ntwo lines\n. In the first line, output a single integer $$$m$$$\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence ($$$n \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot n$$$). In the second line, output $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots, a_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the assumed sequence that Vika could have written on the first piece of paper.\nIf there are multiple suitable sequences, you can output any of them.\nExample\nInput\n6\n3\n4 6 3\n3\n1 2 3\n5\n1 7 9 5 7\n1\n144\n2\n1 1\n5\n1 2 2 1 1\nOutput\n6\n4 3 2 6 3 3\n3\n1 2 3\n6\n1 7 9 3 5 7\n1\n144\n2\n1 1\n6\n1 2 2 1 1 1\nNote\nThe first sample is explained in the problem statement.\nIn the second sample, Vika could have chosen the original sequence."

Parity Sort\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- while loop\n- sorting\n- for loop\n- tuple\n- if statement\nYou have an array of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can apply the following operation to the given array:\nSwap two elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ such that $$$i \\neq j$$$, $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ are either\nboth\neven or\nboth\nodd.\nDetermine whether it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing the operation any number of times (possibly zero).\nFor example, let $$$a$$$ = [$$$7, 10, 1, 3, 2$$$]. Then we can perform $$$3$$$ operations to sort the array:\nSwap $$$a_3 = 1$$$ and $$$a_1 = 7$$$, since $$$1$$$ and $$$7$$$ are odd. We get $$$a$$$ = [$$$1, 10, 7, 3, 2$$$];\nSwap $$$a_2 = 10$$$ and $$$a_5 = 2$$$, since $$$10$$$ and $$$2$$$ are even. We get $$$a$$$ = [$$$1, 2, 7, 3, 10$$$];\nSwap $$$a_4 = 3$$$ and $$$a_3 = 7$$$, since $$$3$$$ and $$$7$$$ are odd. We get $$$a$$$ = [$$$1, 2, 3, 7, 10$$$].\nInput\nThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of array $$$a$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a separate line:\nYES\nif the array can be sorted by applying the operation to it some number of times;\nNO\notherwise.\nYou can output\nYES\nand\nNO\nin any case (for example, strings\nyEs\n,\nyes\n,\nYes\nand\nYES\nwill be recognized as positive response).\nExample\nInput\n6\n5\n7 10 1 3 2\n4\n11 9 3 5\n5\n11 3 15 3 2\n6\n10 7 8 1 2 3\n1\n10\n5\n6 6 4 1 6\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNote\nThe first test case is explained in the problem statement."

Being a top-notch inventor,\nKars\nwishes to enhance his body and become the perfect life form. Unfortunately, $$$n$$$ of the villagers have become suspicious of his ideas. The $$$i$$$-th villager has a suspicion of $$$a_i$$$ on him. Individually each villager is scared of Kars, so they form into groups to be more powerful.\nThe power of the group of villagers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ be defined as $$$f(l,r)$$$ where\n$$$$$$f(l,r) = |a_l - a_{l+1}| + |a_{l + 1} - a_{l + 2}| + \\ldots + |a_{r-1} - a_r|.$$$$$$\nHere $$$|x-y|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$x-y$$$. A group with only one villager has a power of $$$0$$$.\nKars\nwants to break the villagers into exactly $$$k$$$ contiguous subgroups so that the sum of their power is minimized. Formally, he must find $$$k - 1$$$ positive integers $$$1 \\le r_1 < r_2 < \\ldots < r_{k - 1} < n$$$ such that $$$f(1, r_1) + f(r_1 + 1, r_2) + \\ldots + f(r_{k-1} + 1, n)$$$ is minimised. Help\nKars\nin finding the minimum value of $$$f(1, r_1) + f(r_1 + 1, r_2) + \\ldots + f(r_{k-1} + 1, n)$$$.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 100)$$$\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ $$$(1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 100)$$$\u00a0\u2014 the number of villagers and the number of groups they must be split into.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 500)$$$\u00a0\u2014 the suspicion of each of the villagers.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible value of sum of power of all the groups i.\u00a0e. the minimum possible value of $$$f(1,r_1) + f(r_1 + 1, r_2) + \\ldots + f(r_{k-1} + 1, n)$$$.\nExample\nInput\n3\n4 2\n1 3 5 2\n6 3\n1 9 12 4 7 2\n12 8\n1 9 8 2 3 3 1 8 7 7 9 2\nOutput\n4\n11\n2\nNote\nIn the first test case, we will group the villagers with suspicion $$$(1,3,5,2)$$$ into $$$(1,3,5)$$$ and $$$(2)$$$. So, $$$f(1,3) + f(4,4) = (|1 - 3| + |3 - 5|) + 0 = 4 + 0 = 4$$$.\nIn the second test case, we will group the villagers with suspicion $$$(1,9,12,4,7,2)$$$ into $$$(1),(9,12),(4,7,2)$$$. So, $$$f(1,1) + f(2,3) + f(4,6) = 0 + 3 + 8 = 11$$$."

In other words, Alex can replace the subarray $$$[a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\dots, a_r]$$$ by $$$[-a_l, -a_{l + 1}, \\dots, -a_r]$$$ in $$$1$$$ operation.\nFor example, let $$$n = 5$$$, the array is $$$[1, -2, 0, 3, -1]$$$, $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 4$$$, then after the operation the array will be $$$[1, 2, 0, -3, -1]$$$.\nAlex is late for school, so you should help him find the maximum possible sum of numbers in the array, which can be obtained by making any number of operations, as well as the minimum number of operations that must be done for this.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of test cases.

There are others that have the same length and lead to the maximum sum of elements.\nIn the first test case, Alex can make operations: $$$(1, 4)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$, $$$(6, 6)$$$.\nIn the second test case, to get the largest sum you need to make operations: $$$(1, 8)$$$, $$$(5, 6)$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, it is necessary to make only one operation: $$$(2, 3)$$$.",

Sasha and Array Coloring\nSasha found an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers and asked you to paint elements.\nYou have to paint each element of the array. You can use as many colors as you want, but each element should be painted into exactly one color, and for each color, there should be at least one element of that color.\nThe\ncost\nof one color is the value of $$$\\max(S) - \\min(S)$$$, where $$$S$$$ is the sequence of elements of that color. The\ncost\nof the whole coloring is the\nsum\nof costs over all colors.\nFor example, suppose you have an array $$$a = [\\color{red}{1}, \\color{red}{5}, \\color{blue}{6}, \\color{blue}{3}, \\color{red}{4}]$$$, and you painted its elements into two colors as follows: elements on positions $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$ have color $$$1$$$; elements on positions $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ have color $$$2$$$. Then:\nthe cost of the color $$$1$$$ is $$$\\max([1, 5, 4]) - \\min([1, 5, 4]) = 5 - 1 = 4$$$;\nthe cost of the color $$$2$$$ is $$$\\max([6, 3]) - \\min([6, 3]) = 6 - 3 = 3$$$;\nthe total cost of the coloring is $$$7$$$.\nFor the given array $$$a$$$, you have to calculate the\nmaximum\npossible cost of the coloring.\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 length of $$$a$$$.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 array $$$a$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case output the maximum possible cost of the coloring.\nExample\nInput\n6\n5\n1 5 6 3 4\n1\n5\n4\n1 6 3 9\n6\n1 13 9 3 7 2\n4\n2 2 2 2\n5\n4 5 2 2 3\nOutput\n7\n0\n11\n23\n0\n5\nNote\nIn the first example one of the optimal coloring is $$$[\\color{red}{1}, \\color{red}{5}, \\color{blue}{6}, \\color{blue}{3}, \\color{red}{4}]$$$. The answer is $$$(5 - 1) + (6 - 3) = 7$$$.\nIn the second example, the only possible coloring is $$$[\\color{blue}{5}]$$$, for which the answer is $$$5 - 5 = 0$$$.\nIn the third example, the optimal coloring is $$$[\\color{blue}{1}, \\color{red}{6}, \\color{red}{3}, \\color{blue}{9}]$$$, the answer is $$$(9 - 1) + (6 - 3) = 11$$$.",

We can show that Bob can always win as follows: there are two possible first moves for Alice.\nif Alice chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{1, 2\\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins;\nif Alice chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{3\\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins.\nIn the second test case, $$$n = 6$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\\}$$$. Alice can win by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wiping them and writing $$$2$$$ on the first turn. Then the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\\}$$$, and there are three possible responses for Bob:\nif Bob chooses four integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$4$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{2,4\\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;\nif Bob chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{1,2,3\\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;\nif Bob chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 2, 2\\}$$$. Alice can continue by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wiping them and writing $$$4$$$. Then the board becomes $$$\\{1,1,4\\}$$$. The only possible response for Bob is to choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$ and write $$$2$$$ instead of them; then the board becomes $$$\\{2,4\\}$$$, Alice cannot make a move, so she wins."

Politics\nIn a debate club with $$$n$$$ members, including yourself (member $$$1$$$), there are $$$k$$$ opinions to be discussed in sequence. During each discussion, members express their agreement or disagreement with the opinion. Let's define $$$Y$$$ as the number of members who agree and $$$N$$$ as the number of members who disagree. After each discussion, members leave the club based on the following criteria:\nIf more members agree than disagree ($$$Y > N$$$), all members who disagreed leave the club.\nIf more members disagree than agree ($$$Y < N$$$), all members who agreed leave the club.\nIf there is a tie ($$$Y = N$$$), all members leave the club.\nAs the club president, your goal is to stay in the club and maximize the number of members remaining after the meeting. You have access to each member's stance on all $$$k$$$ opinions before the meeting starts, and you can expel any number of members (excluding yourself) before the meeting begins.\nDetermine the maximum number of members, including yourself, who can remain in the club after the meeting. You don't need to provide the specific expulsion strategy but only the maximum number of members that can stay.

Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of members and the number of discussions.\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains a string $$$t_i$$$ of length $$$k$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character in the string $$$t_i$$$ indicates whether the $$$i$$$-th member agrees or disagrees with the $$$j$$$-th opinion if they are present during that discussion.

In this case, they all agree during the first two discussions, after which the third member is in the minority during the third discussion.

A \"\n+\n\" symbol means the member agrees, while a \"\n-\n\" symbol means the member disagrees.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of members, including yourself, who can remain in the club after the meeting.\nExample\nInput\n5\n2 2\n++\n+-\n1 3\n+-+\n4 1\n+\n-\n-\n+\n5 4\n++++\n+--+\n++-+\n+-++\n++++\n4 2\n++\n--\n--\n-+\nOutput\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\nNote\nFor convenience, we will analyze the examples based on who actually attended the meeting (i.\u00a0e. was\nnot\nexpelled) rather than who was expelled.\nExample 1:\nOnly the first member could have attended the meeting, otherwise both members would have left after the second opinion is discussed.\nExample 2:\nThere is only a single member that attends the meeting and stays till the end.\nExample 3:\nThe club has $$$4$$$ members and only one opinion will be discussed during the meeting. Let's analyze the possible outcomes based on the participants in the meeting:\nIf only the first member attends, they'll be the only one left after the meeting.\nIf the first member attends with the second or third member, they will be a tie in the discussion, making them both leave.\nIf the first member attends with the second and third members, the first member will be in the minority and will leave after the discussion, which contradicts the statement.\nIf the first and fourth members attend, they will agree during the discussion and both remain till the end.\nIf the first, second, and fourth members attend, the second member will be in the minority during the discussion, and only the first and fourth members will remain at the end. The same happens if the second member is replaced by the third member.\nIf all four members attend, there will be a tie during the discussion, making everyone leave.\nThe maximum number of members remaining after the meeting is $$$2$$$.\nExample 4:\nThe club has $$$5$$$ members and $$$4$$$ opinions will be discussed during the meeting.\nOne way to achieve the maximum number of members is if only the first, third, and fifth members attend the meeting. In this case, they all agree during the first two discussions, after which the third member is in the minority during the third discussion. Then, the first and fifth members agree in the last discussion, and those two members stay till the end of the meeting.\nExample 5:\nThe club has $$$4$$$ members and $$$2$$$ opinions will be discussed.\nIf the first three members attend the meeting, the first member will be in the minority during the first discussion and will leave the club. After that, the second and third members will both disagree with the second opinion, and they both will stay till the end of the meeting. In this way, there will be 2 members left after the meeting, but it is an invalid outcome, as it forces the first member to leave. Therefore, the maximum number of 1 member is achieved if only the first member attends the meeting."

Lame King\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- while loop\n- for loop\n- matrix operation\n- tuple\n- if statement\nYou are given a checkerboard of size $$$201 \\times 201$$$, i.\u00a0e. it has $$$201$$$ rows and $$$201$$$ columns. The rows of this checkerboard are numbered from $$$-100$$$ to $$$100$$$ from bottom to top. The columns of this checkerboard are numbered from $$$-100$$$ to $$$100$$$ from left to right. The notation $$$(r, c)$$$ denotes the cell located in the $$$r$$$-th row and the $$$c$$$-th column.\nThere is a king piece at position $$$(0, 0)$$$ and it wants to get to position $$$(a, b)$$$ as soon as possible. In this problem our king is lame. Each second, the king makes exactly one of the following five moves.\nSkip move. King's position remains unchanged.\nGo up. If the current position of the king is $$$(r, c)$$$ he goes to position $$$(r + 1, c)$$$.\nGo down. Position changes from $$$(r, c)$$$ to $$$(r - 1, c)$$$.\nGo right. Position changes from $$$(r, c)$$$ to $$$(r, c + 1)$$$.\nGo left. Position changes from $$$(r, c)$$$ to $$$(r, c - 1)$$$.\nKing is\nnot allowed\nto make moves that put him outside of the board. The important consequence of the king being lame is that he is\nnot allowed\nto make the same move during two consecutive seconds. For example, if the king goes right, the next second he can only skip, go up, down, or left.\nWhat is the minimum number of seconds the lame king needs to reach position $$$(a, b)$$$?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.

Serval and Mocha's Array\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- tuple\n- \n- while loop\n- if statement\n- for loop\nMocha likes arrays, and Serval gave her an array consisting of positive integers as a gift.\nMocha thinks that for an array of positive integers $$$a$$$, it is\ngood\niff the\ngreatest common divisor\nof all the elements in $$$a$$$ is no more than its length. And for an array of at least $$$2$$$ positive integers, it is\nbeautiful\niff all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$ are good.\nFor example:\n$$$[3,6]$$$ is not good, because $$$\\gcd(3,6)=3$$$ is greater than its length $$$2$$$.\n$$$[1,2,4]$$$ is both good and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$, which are $$$[1,2]$$$ and $$$[1,2,4]$$$, are both good.\n$$$[3,6,1]$$$ is good but not beautiful, because $$$[3,6]$$$ is not good.\nNow Mocha gives you the gift array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and she wants to know whether array $$$a$$$ could become beautiful by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$. It is allowed to keep the array $$$a$$$ unchanged.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 100$$$) \u2014 the length of array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n\\leq 10^6$$$) \u2014 the elements of array $$$a$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print\nYes\nif it is possible to reorder the elements in $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful, and print\nNo\nif not.\nYou can output\nYes\nand\nNo\nin any case (for example, strings\nyEs\n,\nyes\n,\nYes\nand\nYES\nwill be recognized as a positive response).\nExample\nInput\n6\n2\n3 6\n3\n1 2 4\n3\n3 6 1\n3\n15 35 21\n4\n35 10 35 14\n5\n1261 227821 143 4171 1941\nOutput\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNote\nIn the first test case, neither $$$[3,6]$$$ nor $$$[6,3]$$$ are beautiful, so it's impossible to obtain a beautiful array by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$.\nIn the second test case, $$$[1,2,4]$$$ is already beautiful. Keeping the array $$$a$$$ unchanged can obtain a beautiful array."

Hall of Fame\nThalia is a Legendary Grandmaster in chess. She has $$$n$$$ trophies in a line numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (from left to right) and a lamp standing next to each of them (the lamps are numbered as the trophies).\nA lamp can be directed either to the left or to the right, and it illuminates all trophies in that direction (but not the one it is next to). More formally, Thalia has a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '\nL\n' and '\nR\n' which represents the lamps' current directions. The lamp $$$i$$$ illuminates:\ntrophies $$$1,2,\\ldots, i-1$$$ if $$$s_i$$$ is '\nL\n';\ntrophies $$$i+1,i+2,\\ldots, n$$$ if $$$s_i$$$ is '\nR\n'.\nShe can perform the following operation\nat most\nonce:\nChoose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i < n$$$);\nSwap the lamps $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ (without changing their directions). That is, swap $$$s_i$$$ with $$$s_{i+1}$$$.\nThalia asked you to illuminate all her trophies (make each trophy illuminated by at least one lamp), or to tell her that it is impossible to do so. If it is possible, you can choose to perform an operation or to do nothing. Notice that lamps\ncannot\nchange direction, it is only allowed to swap adjacent ones.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of trophies.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of characters '\nL\n' and '\nR\n' \u00a0\u2014 the $$$i$$$-th character describes the direction of the $$$i$$$-th lamp.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100\\,000$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case print $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to illuminate all trophies by performing one operation (or doing nothing). Otherwise, print $$$0$$$ if you choose not to perform the operation (i.e., the trophies are illuminated by the initial positioning of the lamps), or an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i < n$$$) if you choose to swap lamps $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$.\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\nExample\nInput\n6\n2\nLL\n2\nLR\n2\nRL\n2\nRR\n7\nLLRLLLR\n7\nRRLRRRL\nOutput\n-1\n1\n0\n-1\n3\n6\nNote\nIn the first example, it is possible to swap lamps $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, or do nothing. In any case, the string \"\nLL\n\" is obtained. Not all trophies are illuminated since trophy $$$2$$$ is not illuminated by any lamp \u00a0\u2014 lamp $$$1$$$ illuminates nothing and lamp $$$2$$$ illuminates only the trophy $$$1$$$.\nIn the second example, it is necessary to swap lamps $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. The string becomes \"\nRL\n\". Trophy $$$1$$$ is illuminated by lamp $$$2$$$ and trophy $$$2$$$ is illuminated by lamp $$$1$$$, hence it is possible to illuminate all trophies.\nIn the third example, all trophies are initially illuminated \u00a0\u2014 hence, not performing any operation is a valid solution.\nIn the last two examples performing swaps is not necessary as all trophies are illuminated initially. But, the presented solutions are also valid.",

If $$$x > y$$$, then the observed team wins, and if $$$x < y$$$, then it loses.\nTo find out if there is a correlation, the scientists gathered information about the results of teams in lower leagues. The information they found is the number of matches played by the team ($$$n$$$), the number of goals scored in these matches ($$$a$$$), and the number of goals conceded in these matches ($$$b$$$).\nYou are given this information for a single team. You are asked to calculate the minimum number of draws that could have happened during the team's matches and provide a list of match scores with the minimum number of draws.\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$\u00a0\u2014 the number of matches played by the team ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line contains an integer $$$a$$$\u00a0\u2014 the total number of goals scored by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \\le a \\le 1000$$$). The third line contains an integer $$$b$$$\u00a0\u2014 the total number of goals conceded by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \\le b \\le 1000$$$).\nOutput\nIn the first line, print a single integer $$$d$$$\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of draws.\nIn the following $$$n$$$ lines, print a list of match scores, each line in the format \"$$$x$$$\n:\n$$$y$$$\", where $$$x$$$ is the number of goals scored in the match, and $$$y$$$\u00a0\u2013 the number of goals conceded, so that exactly $$$d$$$ of these matches have ended in a draw.

A rook can move into any cell in its row or column if no other rook stands on its path.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 8$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the chessboard and the number of the rooks.\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the position of the $$$i$$$-th rook: $$$x_i$$$ is the row and $$$y_i$$$ is the column.\nNo two rooks occupy the same cell. No two rooks attack each other.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print \"\nYES\n\" if it's possible to move exactly one rook into a different cell so that no two rooks still attack each other. Otherwise, print \"\nNO\n\".\nExample\nInput\n2\n2 2\n1 2\n2 1\n3 1\n2 2\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNote\nIn the first testcase, the rooks are in the opposite corners of a $$$2 \\times 2$$$ board. Each of them has a move into a neighbouring corner, but moving there means getting attacked by another rook.\nIn the second testcase, there's a single rook in a middle of a $$$3 \\times 3$$$ board. It has $$$4$$$ valid moves, and every move is fine because there's no other rook to attack it."

Number Replacement\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- recursion\n- \n- \n- for loop\n- if statement\nAn integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is being transformed into an array of lowercase English letters using the following prodecure:\nWhile there is at least one number in the array:\nChoose any number $$$x$$$ from the array $$$a$$$, and any letter of the English alphabet $$$y$$$.\nReplace all occurrences of number $$$x$$$ with the letter $$$y$$$.\nFor example, if we initially had an array $$$a = [2, 3, 2, 4, 1]$$$, then we could transform it the following way:\nChoose the number $$$2$$$ and the letter\nc\n. After that $$$a = [c, 3, c, 4, 1]$$$.\nChoose the number $$$3$$$ and the letter\na\n. After that $$$a = [c, a, c, 4, 1]$$$.\nChoose the number $$$4$$$ and the letter\nt\n. After that $$$a = [c, a, c, t, 1]$$$.\nChoose the number $$$1$$$ and the letter\na\n. After that $$$a = [c, a, c, t, a]$$$.\nAfter the transformation all letters are united into a string, in our example we get the string \"\ncacta\n\".\nHaving the array $$$a$$$ and the string $$$s$$$ determine if the string $$$s$$$ could be got from the array $$$a$$$ after the described transformation?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen the description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the string $$$s$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 50$$$) \u2014 the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output \"\nYES\n\", if we can get the string $$$s$$$ from the array $$$a$$$, and \"\nNO\n\" otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.\nExample\nInput\n7\n5\n2 3 2 4 1\ncacta\n1\n50\na\n2\n11 22\nab\n4\n1 2 2 1\naaab\n5\n1 2 3 2 1\naaaaa\n6\n1 10 2 9 3 8\nazzfdb\n7\n1 2 3 4 1 1 2\nabababb\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNote\nThe first test case corresponds to the sample described in the statement.\nIn the second test case we can choose the number $$$50$$$ and the letter\na\n.\nIn the third test case we can choose the number $$$11$$$ and the letter\na\n, after that $$$a = [a, 22]$$$. Then we choose the number $$$22$$$ and the letter\nb\nand get $$$a = [a, b]$$$.\nIn the fifth test case we can change all numbers one by one to the letter\na\n."

For example, $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ is a permutation of size $$$4$$$; $$$[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]$$$ is a permutation of size $$$5$$$; $$$[1, 4, 3]$$$ is not a permutation (the integer $$$2$$$ is absent), $$$[2, 1, 3, 1]$$$ is not a permutation (the integer $$$1$$$ appears twice).\nA\nsubsegment\nof a permutation is a contiguous subsequence of that permutation. For example, the permutation $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ has $$$10$$$ subsegments: $$$[2]$$$, $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 4]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[1]$$$, $$$[1, 4]$$$, $$$[1, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[4]$$$, $$$[4, 3]$$$ and $$$[3]$$$.\nThe\nvalue\nof the permutation is the number of its subsegments which are also permutations. For example, the value of $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ is $$$3$$$ since the subsegments $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[1]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ are permutations.\nYou have to construct a permutation of size $$$n$$$ with\nminimum possible value\namong all permutations of size $$$n$$$.\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 48$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen, $$$t$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 50$$$) representing the $$$i$$$-th test case.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers \u2014 the permutation of size $$$n$$$ with\nminimum possible value\n. If there are multiple such permutations, print any of them.\nExample\nInput\n2\n5\n6\nOutput\n1 4 3 5 2\n4 1 6 2 5 3\nNote\nIn the first example, the permutation $$$[1, 4, 3, 5, 2]$$$ is one of the possible answers; its value is $$$2$$$.\nIn the second example, the permutation $$$[4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3]$$$ is one of the possible answers; its value is $$$2$$$."

Decode String\nPolycarp has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nHe encodes it using the following algorithm.\nHe goes through the letters of the string $$$s$$$ from left to right and for each letter Polycarp considers its number in the alphabet:\nif the letter number is single-digit number (less than $$$10$$$), then just writes it out;\nif the letter number is a two-digit number (greater than or equal to $$$10$$$), then it writes it out and adds the number\n0\nafter.\nFor example, if the string $$$s$$$ is\ncode\n, then Polycarp will encode this string as follows:\n'\nc\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$3$$$-rd letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n3\nto the code (the code becomes equal to\n3\n);\n'\no\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$15$$$-th letter of the alphabet.

Decode String\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- for loop\n- matrix operation\n- if statement\n- pass statement\n- while loop\nPolycarp has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nHe encodes it using the following algorithm.\nHe goes through the letters of the string $$$s$$$ from left to right and for each letter Polycarp considers its number in the alphabet:\nif the letter number is single-digit number (less than $$$10$$$), then just writes it out;\nif the letter number is a two-digit number (greater than or equal to $$$10$$$), then it writes it out and adds the number\n0\nafter.\nFor example, if the string $$$s$$$ is\ncode\n, then Polycarp will encode this string as follows:\n'\nc\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$3$$$-rd letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n3\nto the code (the code becomes equal to\n3\n);\n'\no\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$15$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n15\nto the code and also\n0\n(the code becomes\n3150\n);\n'\nd\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$4$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n4\nto the code (the code becomes\n31504\n);\n'\ne\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$5$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Therefore, Polycarp adds\n5\nto the code (the code becomes\n315045\n).\nThus, code of string\ncode\nis\n315045\n.\nYou are given a string $$$t$$$ resulting from encoding the string $$$s$$$. Your task is to decode it (get the original string $$$s$$$ by $$$t$$$).\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.\nThe descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe first line of description of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the given code.\nThe second line of the description of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ \u2014 the given code. It is guaranteed that there exists such a string of lowercase Latin letters, as a result of encoding which the string $$$t$$$ is obtained.\nOutput\nFor each test case output the required string $$$s$$$ \u2014 the string that gives string $$$t$$$ as the result of encoding. It is guaranteed that such a string always exists. It can be shown that such a string is always unique.\nExample\nInput\n9\n6\n315045\n4\n1100\n7\n1213121\n6\n120120\n18\n315045615018035190\n7\n1111110\n7\n1111100\n5\n11111\n4\n2606\nOutput\ncode\naj\nabacaba\nll\ncodeforces\naaaak\naaaaj\naaaaa\nzf\nNote\nThe first test case is explained above.\nIn the second test case, the answer is\naj\n. Indeed, the number of the letter\na\nis equal to $$$1$$$, so\n1\nwill be appended to the code. The number of the letter\nj\nis $$$10$$$, so\n100\nwill be appended to the code. The resulting code is\n1100\n.\nThere are no zeros in the third test case, which means that the numbers of all letters are less than $$$10$$$ and are encoded as one digit. The original string is\nabacaba\n.\nIn the fourth test case, the string $$$s$$$ is equal to\nll\n. The letter\nl\nhas the number $$$12$$$ and is encoded as\n120\n. So\nll\nis indeed\n120120\n."

Description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,m \\leq 50$$$, $$$m \\leq n$$$) \u2014 the lengths of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.\nThe third line of each test case contains a string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if AquaMoon can change $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ by using these options; otherwise, output \"NO\".\nYou may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).\nExample\nInput\n10\n6 2\n001001\n11\n6 2\n110111\n01\n6 2\n000001\n11\n6 2\n111111\n01\n8 5\n10000101\n11010\n7 4\n1010001\n1001\n8 6\n01010010\n010010\n8 4\n01010101\n1001\n8 4\n10101010\n0110\n7 5\n1011100\n11100\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNote\nIn the first test case, you can use\nOperation 2\nfour times to make $$$a$$$ equals to $$$b$$$.\nIn the second test case, you can use\nOperation 1\nfour times to make $$$a$$$ equals to $$$b$$$.\nIn the third test case, it can be proved that no matter how we use the operations, it is impossible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, it can be proved that no matter how we use the operations, it is impossible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.\nIn the fifth test case, you can use\nOperation 2\nthree times to make $$$a$$$ become $$$10101$$$, so the first element of $$$a$$$ equals to the first element of $$$b$$$, but it can be proved that no matter how to operate, the second to the fifth elements of $$$a$$$ can't be the same as $$$b$$$."

Optimal Path\nYou are given a table $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\times m$$$. We will consider the table rows numbered from top to bottom from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the columns numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. We will denote a cell that is in the $$$i$$$-th row and in the $$$j$$$-th column as $$$(i, j)$$$. In the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ there is written a number $$$(i - 1) \\cdot m + j$$$, that is $$$a_{ij} = (i - 1) \\cdot m + j$$$.\nA turtle initially stands in the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and it wants to come to the cell $$$(n, m)$$$. From the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ it can in one step go to one of the cells $$$(i + 1, j)$$$ or $$$(i, j + 1)$$$, if it exists. A path is a sequence of cells in which for every two adjacent in the sequence cells the following satisfies: the turtle can reach from the first cell to the second cell in one step. A cost of a path is the sum of numbers that are written in the cells of the path.\nFor example, with $$$n = 2$$$ and $$$m = 3$$$ the table will look as shown above. The turtle can take the following path: $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2) \\rightarrow (1, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 3)$$$. The cost of such way is equal to $$$a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{23} = 12$$$. On the other hand, the paths $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 1)$$$ and $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 3)$$$ are incorrect, because in the first path the turtle can't make a step $$$(2, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 1)$$$, and in the second path it can't make a step $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 3)$$$.\nYou are asked to tell the turtle a minimal possible cost of a path from the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ to the cell $$$(n, m)$$$. Please note that the cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(n, m)$$$ are a part of the way.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nA single line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the table $$$a$$$ respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single integer \u2014 a minimal possible cost of a path from the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ to the cell $$$(n, m)$$$.\nExample\nInput\n7\n1 1\n2 3\n3 2\n7 1\n1 10\n5 5\n10000 10000\nOutput\n1\n12\n13\n28\n55\n85\n500099995000\nNote\nIn the first test case the only possible path consists of a single cell $$$(1, 1)$$$.\nThe path with the minimal cost in the second test case is shown in the statement.\nIn the fourth and the fifth test cases there is only one path from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$. Both paths visit every cell in the table.",
